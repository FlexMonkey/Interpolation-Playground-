# Interpolation-Playground-
Swift playground demonstrating lerp, smooth step, Catcall-Rom and others!

Based on [http://sol.gfxile.net/interpolation/index.html](http://sol.gfxile.net/interpolation/index.html), this playground demonstrates a selection of different interpolation functions. The playground is great because it comes with free graphs!
